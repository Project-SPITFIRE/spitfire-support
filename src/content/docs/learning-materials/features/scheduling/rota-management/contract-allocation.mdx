Contract Allocation helps you manage operational contracts by tracking event counts and operational days against allocated capacity. Create, edit, and monitor contracts with comprehensive event management and allocation tracking.

## What is Contract Allocation?

Contract Allocation is a comprehensive system for managing operational contracts that includes:

- **Contract overview cards** showing events and operational day usage
- **Multi-step contract creation** with succession plan duplication
- **Event management** with detailed scheduling and manager assignments
- **Capacity tracking** with visual indicators and conflict monitoring

## Best Practices

:::tip[Contract Management Tips]
- **Plan capacity carefully:** Set realistic operational day estimates based on contract requirements
- **Use succession plan duplication:** Save time by copying manager structures from similar contracts
- **Monitor conflicts regularly:** Check the dashboard for active conflicts and resolve promptly
- **Track event distribution:** Ensure balanced allocation across operational periods
- **Update contract details:** Keep client codes and descriptions current for accurate reporting
:::

:::note[Integration Points]
Contract Allocation integrates with:
- **Succession Planning:** Manager assignments feed from succession plans
- **Event Management:** Events are linked to specific contracts for tracking
- **Capacity Planning:** Operational day tracking affects resource allocation
- **Reporting:** Contract data feeds into operational performance reports
