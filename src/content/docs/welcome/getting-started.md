## Purpose of this site
This site helps you perform day‑to‑day operational tasks: schedule management, submitting and tracking requests, and managing EOS tasks (where applicable). Pick your role, scan the overview, then follow links to the task you need.

## Who should read this first
- Operations Managers: scheduling, requests, EOS task follow‑up
- Admins: user, team, and role configuration
- Other roles (COO, HOO, Deputies, Logistics, Support) when their pages become available

## Before you start
You need:
- An active platform account
- An assigned role (check with an Admin if unsure)
- Your initial password or SSO access

If you are unsure what you can do, open your role overview (e.g. [Ops Manager Overview](/roles/ops-manager/role-overview)).

## First login checklist
1. Sign in.
2. Confirm your role (shown in the interface header or profile area).
3. Open your Dashboard.
4. Review any assigned tasks or outstanding requests.
5. Bookmark this documentation site for quick reference.

## Core things you can do

| Action | Where to go |
|--------|-------------|
| See what your role allows | Your Role → Overview |
| Submit a new operational request | Your Role → Submit Request |
| Update or add info to a request | Your Role → Update Request |
| Track EOS tasks (if enabled) | Your Role → EOS / Tasks section |
| View scheduled shifts / events | Scheduling / Rota pages |
| Manage users & teams (Admins) | Admin → User / Team Management |

## Quick links (current roles)
- Admin: [/roles/admin/role-overview](/roles/admin/role-overview)
- Ops Manager: [/roles/ops-manager/role-overview](/roles/ops-manager/role-overview)

(Additional role pages will appear here when available.)

## Typical first tasks

| Role | First 3 things to do |
|------|----------------------|
| Ops Manager | Review Dashboard → Submit a Request → Check EOS Tasks |
| Admin | Review Users → Create/Update Team → Verify Roles |

## Understanding your Dashboard (Ops Manager example)
Your dashboard highlights:
- Scheduled shifts & events
- Pending / in‑progress requests
- Assigned EOS tasks (with status)
- Any compliance or data gaps needing action

Use it each morning to set priorities.

## Working with requests
1. Open Submit Request for a new operational, resource, or process change need.
2. Fill required fields (title, type, description, related contract/event).
3. Submit and note the status label.
4. To refine details later, open Update Request.

Keep requests clear and focused on one need. Use updates instead of creating duplicates.

## EOS tasks (where available)
If your role includes EOS tasks:
- View list from the EOS / Tasks section.
- Open a task to see subtasks and status.
- Update only the subtasks assigned to you.
- Return regularly until all are complete.

## Scheduling basics
If you have scheduling permissions:
- Rota / Scheduling pages show shifts or event allocations.
- Filter by contract, event, or date range.
- Update assignments according to staffing guidelines.
- Resolve “pending” or “unassigned” items promptly.

## Troubleshooting access
| Issue | What to do |
|-------|------------|
| Feature missing | Confirm your role → ask Admin if permission is expected |
| Can’t submit request | Ensure required fields complete; retry after refresh |
| Task list empty | You may have no assignments yet or lack EOS access |
| Wrong role shown | Sign out/in; if still wrong, contact Admin |

## Common next steps

| Goal | Page |
|------|------|
| Learn role specifics | Your Role Overview |
| Create first request | Submit Request (from role section) |
| Follow up on a request | Update Request page |
| Track operational tasks | EOS / Tasks (if enabled) |
| Adjust scheduling | Rota / Scheduling pages |
| Manage users (Admins) | User Management |

## Need help
- Role or permission issues → Admin
- Missing feature → Raise with your line manager
- Data inaccuracy → Update directly if permitted or notify owner
- Urgent operational blocker → Follow internal escalation route

:::note
If a page refers to a feature not yet active for your role, it may be rolling out gradually.
