Succession Planning ensures continuous operational coverage by establishing clear backup arrangements for contracts and events. Assign primary and backup managers across multiple succession levels to maintain operational continuity.

## What is Succession Planning?

Succession Planning creates structured manager assignments for contracts with multiple backup levels:

- **Contract-based assignments** with up to 6 manager succession levels
- **Primary and backup coverage** for operational continuity
- **Manager rotation** and workload distribution
- **Upload functionality** for bulk succession plan management
