## Best practices

**For Task Owners**:
- Break down complex work into clear, actionable subtasks
- Set realistic deadlines with buffer time
- Monitor progress regularly and update stakeholders
- Document important decisions and changes

**For Subtask Assignees**:
- Update status promptly when starting or completing work
- Communicate blockers immediately
- Ask questions rather than making assumptions
- Coordinate with other subtask owners when needed
