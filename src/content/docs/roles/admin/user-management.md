## Monitoring user activity

Use the **Logs** section to:
- Track user login activity

- Audit role permission changes
- Identify unusual access patterns

## Troubleshooting role access

**If a user can't access a feature:**
1. Verify their assigned role in Account Management
2. Check the role's page access permissions
3. Ensure the correct permissions are enabled for that page
4. Confirm no system-wide restrictions are in place
5. Have the user log out and back in to refresh permissions

**If role changes don't apply:**
- Users may need to log out and back in
- Clear browser cache if issues persist
- Verify the role was saved correctly
- Check for conflicting permission settings
