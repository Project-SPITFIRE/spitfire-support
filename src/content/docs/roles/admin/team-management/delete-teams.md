You can remove teams that are no longer needed or have been reorganized.

## Before you delete a team

**Important considerations:**
- Ensure all team members are reassigned to other teams first
- Archive team data if required for compliance
- Notify affected users before deletion
- Document the reason for team deletion

## How to delete a team

1. Go to **Admin** → **Team Management** → **View All Teams**
2. Find the team you want to delete
3. Click the **Actions** menu next to the team name
4. Select **Delete Team**
5. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog

## Deletion checklist

- [ ] All team members have been moved to other teams
- [ ] No active projects depend on this team structure
- [ ] Team data has been archived if needed
- [ ] Stakeholders have been notified
- [ ] Deletion reason has been documented

## What happens when you delete a team

- The team structure is permanently removed
- Former team members lose team-specific permissions
- Team-related data is archived according to retention policies
- Any team-specific workflows are disabled

## Alternative to deletion

Consider **deactivating** the team instead of deleting if:
- You might need to recreate it later
- Historical reporting requires the team structure
- Compliance requires maintaining the organizational record
