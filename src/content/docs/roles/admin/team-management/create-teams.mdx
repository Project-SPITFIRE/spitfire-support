You can organize users into functional teams for better collaboration and access control.


## Creating a Team

Follow these steps to create a new team:


   1. Navigate to **Admin** → **Team Management** → Click on **Add Group** button
   2. Enter team details:
      - Team name
      - Description
      - Team Lead
      - Team Members
   3. Set team permissions and access levels
   4. Add initial team members
   5. Click **Create Team**





## Team organization tips

- Create teams based on functional responsibilities
- Keep team sizes manageable (5-15 members typically work best)
- Assign clear team leaders for accountability
- Use descriptive names that reflect the team's purpose

## Team setup considerations

**Permissions**: Consider what access levels the team needs collectively
**Hierarchy**: Think about how this team fits into the larger organization
**Communication**: Plan how team members will collaborate
**Growth**: Allow room for the team to expand if needed

## What you can configure

- Team-specific access permissions
- Default workflows for team members
