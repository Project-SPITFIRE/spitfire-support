## What happens next

After you click **Create Account**:

- They'll have access to their assigned team's resources and information

:::note[Troubleshooting: Email not received]
If the new user doesn't receive the login credentials email, ask them to check their spam or junk folder. Some email systems may filter automated messages. If the email still can't be found, you can resend the credentials from the user management section.
