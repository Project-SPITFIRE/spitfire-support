The **Operational Tracker** provides detailed visibility into operational performance across contracts and managers. It complements the **Dashboard** by allowing you to drill down into specific contracts or managers and view operational days over time.

## Tabs in the Operational Tracker

### 1. Operational Days per Contract

- **Purpose**: Track how many days each contract has been active across the year.
- **Features**:  
  • Filter by a specific contract to see operational activity.  
  • Displays operational days broken down **month by month**.  
  • Calculates the **total operational days** for the contract across the selected year.  
  • Shows **estimated operational days** to provide a forecast against actuals.

- **Why it matters**:  
  • Helps you analyze contract utilization and ensure fair allocation.  
  • Useful for spotting trends like underused or overextended contracts.  
  • Supports decision-making for renewals, extensions, or resource adjustments.

## How to use the Operational Tracker effectively

1. **Monthly Review**: Check contract-level operational days at the start of each month to plan staffing distribution.
2. **Spot Conflicts Early**: Use the contract filter to detect over- or under-utilization before it impacts schedules.
3. **Manager Workload Balance**: Monitor manager-level data quarterly to ensure fair workload distribution.
4. **Forecasting**: Compare actual vs. estimated operational days to adjust staffing or contract commitments.
5. **Strategic Planning**: Use insights to inform succession plans, contract negotiations, and team adjustments.

- Review both tabs regularly to align scheduling with operational capacity.
