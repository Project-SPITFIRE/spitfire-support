The **Dashboard** is your operational control center. It provides a high-level overview of key scheduling, task, and compliance metrics, helping you track performance and quickly identify issues that need action.

## What you can see

### Key Metrics

- **Total Schedules This Month**  
  Displays the total number of schedules created in the current month.  
  • Shows a percentage change compared to the previous month (up or down).  
  • Helps you track scheduling workload trends over time.

- **Events This Week**  
  Shows the total number of events assigned to you or your team this week.  
  • Allows you to plan resources according to upcoming workload.  
  • Useful for identifying busy weeks or upcoming bottlenecks.

- **Pending CIPHR**  
  Flags scheduling or leave conflicts detected from CIPHR imports.  
  • Conflicts may include overlapping shifts, unapproved leave, or misaligned working hours.  
  • Address these promptly to maintain accurate staff allocation.

- **EOS Tasks**  
  Displays the number of EOS tasks assigned to you and how many have been completed this week.  
  • Provides quick visibility into task load and completion rate.  
  • Helps track team responsiveness and efficiency in operational support.

- **Outstanding Compliance Checks**  
  Lists compliance checks that are still pending or have been recently completed.  
  • Ensures operational processes remain compliant with internal or external standards.  
  • Important for audits and quality assurance.

### Visual Analytics

- **Operational Days per Contract (This Month)**  
  A chart showing how many days each contract has been operational within the current month.  
  • Useful for understanding staff utilization.  
  • Helps highlight over- or under-allocation of contracted hours.

- **EOS Task Progress**  
  A progress chart categorizing EOS tasks by status: _Completed_, _In Progress_, and _Not Started_.  
  • Provides a real-time picture of overall task completion.  
  • Helps identify which areas need focus to avoid delays.

## How to use the dashboard effectively

1. **Start each week by reviewing Events This Week** to prepare for resource allocation.
2. **Check Pending CIPHR daily** to resolve conflicts before they impact schedules.
3. **Monitor EOS Task progress regularly** to keep subtasks on track and avoid bottlenecks.
4. **Compare Total Schedules This Month with last month’s trend** to spot unusual increases or decreases in workload.
5. **Review Compliance Checks** to ensure all processes are audit-ready and compliant.
6. **Use Operational Days per Contract** to verify fair workload distribution across contracts.

## Quick Tips

- Use the **Dashboard charts** to spot issues faster than scanning tables.
- Prioritize resolving **Pending CIPHR conflicts** first — they directly affect schedule accuracy.
- Treat the **EOS Task progress chart** as your live tracker for operational effectiveness.
- Think of the dashboard as a **“morning check-in” tool** — review it at the start of your shift to set priorities.
