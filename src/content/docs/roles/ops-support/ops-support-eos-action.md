The **EOS Task Management** feature allows Operations Support to create, assign, update, and track EOS-related tasks and subtasks. It provides visibility into task progress, activity history, and allows filtering/searching for efficient task handling. Ops Support can also update **assigned subtasks** or the **main task status**.

## How to Manage EOS Tasks

### 1. Create an EOS Task

1. Click **Create Task**.
2. Enter the **task title**.
3. Set the **priority level** (High, Medium, Low).
4. Assign the **main user** responsible for the task.
5. Add **subtasks** if applicable and assign them to users.
6. Set a **deadline**.
7. Add any **remarks** for context.
8. Click **Save** to create the task.

### 2. Edit an EOS Task

- Select a task from the list or board.
- Update the following fields as needed:  
  • Task Title  
  • Priority Level  
  • Assigned User  
  • Deadline  
  • Remarks
- Save changes to update the task.

### 3. Add Notes & Track Activity

- Add **notes** to provide updates or clarifications.
- View the **Activity Log** to see who updated the task and when.
- All changes are recorded for accountability.

---

### 4. Progress Overview & Status Updates

- View the **task status**:  
  • Not Started  
  • In Progress  
  • Completed
- Ops Support can update:  
  • **Assigned Subtasks** (if they are assigned to the Ops Support user).  
  • **Main Task Status** to reflect overall progress.
- Monitor subtasks to ensure progress on each assigned responsibility.

---

### 5. Search and Filter

- **Search by task title** for quick access.
- **Filter tasks** by:  
  • Month  
  • Week  
  • Priority (High, Medium, Low)  
  • Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)

By default, the system shows tasks for the **current week**.

## Why it Matters
