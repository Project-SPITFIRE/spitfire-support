## How to Use Account Management Effectively

1. **Search or filter** by role to quickly locate the user you need to manage.
2. **View account details** before making changes to confirm you’re working on the correct account.
3. **Edit roles and teams** carefully to ensure proper access control.
4. Use **Deactivate** instead of deleting to keep user history intact.
5. Regularly review accounts to ensure only active employees have login access.

## Quick Tips

- Always double-check role and team assignments after edits.
- Use the **Resend Link** option if users report login or activation issues.
- For compliance, keep accounts of former employees deactivated rather than deleted.
