The **Create User Account** feature allows Operations Support to onboard new users into the system.  
When a new account is created, an **automatic email** is sent to the user with instructions to set their password.

## How to Create a New User Account

1. **Go to Create User Account**

   - From the navigation menu, select **Create User Account**.

2. **Fill in the Required Fields**

   - **First Name** – Enter the user’s given name.
   - **Last Name** – Enter the user’s surname.
   - **Email** – Enter the user’s company email.
   - **Role** – Select **one role** from the dropdown.
   - **Team** – Select **one team** from the dropdown.

   ⚠️ At creation time, the system only allows **one role** and **one team**.  
   Additional roles or teams can be added later through **Account Management > Edit User**.

3. **Click "Create Account"**

   - After filling in all fields, click the **Create Account** button to submit.

4. **Automatic Activation Email**
   - Once submitted, the system sends an **activation email** to the new user.
   - The email contains a **link to set their password** and activate their account.

## What Happens Next

- The account is added to the system with the assigned role and team.
- The user cannot log in until they click the link in their activation email and set their password.
- If the user doesn’t receive the email, you can go to **Account Management** and use **Resend Link**.

## Quick Tips

- Double-check the **email address** before creating the account.
- Assign the most appropriate **initial role and team**; these can be changed later.
- Remind new users to check their **spam/junk folders** for the activation email.
- Use the **Resend Link** feature if the activation email is missed.
