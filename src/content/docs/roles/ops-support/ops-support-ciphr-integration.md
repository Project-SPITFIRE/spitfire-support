The **CIPHR Integration** module ensures that employee records and scheduling data remain aligned with HR data managed in CIPHR. It allows you to upload CIPHR exports, track the upload date, and filter records by status for faster resolution of conflicts.

## Key Capabilities

- **Upload CIPHR Exports** – Import `.xlsx` files exported directly from CIPHR.
- **CIPHR Date Display** – See the exact export date of the uploaded file to confirm data freshness.
- **Status Filtering** – Quickly filter records by:  
  • **Approved** – Validated and accepted records.  
  • **Declined** – Records flagged or rejected.  
  • **Pending** – Items awaiting resolution or confirmation.

## How to Use the CIPHR Integration

1. **Prepare the Export**

   - Log in to your CIPHR account.
   - Export the dataset as an `.xlsx` file.
   - Save it locally for upload.

2. **Upload the File**

   - Navigate to the **CIPHR Integration** module in the system.
   - Click **Upload** and select your `.xlsx` file.
   - The system will process and align records with existing data.

3. **Check the CIPHR Date**

   - Once uploaded, the integration displays the **CIPHR export date**.
   - Confirm the date matches your most recent file to avoid outdated data.

4. **Filter by Status**
   - Use the status filter to focus on what matters:  
     • Review **Pending** items to clear unresolved cases.  
     • Investigate **Declined** records for errors or conflicts.  
     • Confirm **Approved** records for accuracy and completeness.
