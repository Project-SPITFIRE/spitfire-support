The **Manage Request** feature allows Operations Support to review, update, and complete operational requests submitted within the system. Requests can be searched, filtered, updated with notes or attachments, and closed once resolved.

## How to Manage Requests

### 1. Search and Filter Requests

- **Search**: Enter the request title or submitter name to quickly locate a request.
- **Filter**: Narrow down requests by status:  
  • **Not Yet Started**  
  • **Completed**  
  • **Missing Information**

### 2. View and Update a Request

1. Select a request from the list.
2. Review the details of the request (title, description, type, dates, attachments).
3. Add a **note** to provide updates or clarifications.
4. Optionally attach an **image or video** for supporting evidence.
5. All updates are tracked in the **Activity Log** for transparency.

### 3. Mark Request Status
