The **Events Mapping** feature allows Operations Support to manage schedules, allocate managers, and resolve conflicts efficiently. You can filter by manager, month, or year, and switch between detailed and compact views.

> **Note:** All events under a selected contract will be displayed in the schedule for the manager, providing a full view of workload and assignments.

## Features

### 1. Filters

- **Manager Filter** – Select one or multiple managers to view their schedules.
- **Month & Year Filter** – View schedules for a specific month or year.

### 2. Views

- **Detailed View** – Full schedule per manager with the ability to create, edit, or delete schedules.
- **Compact View** – Summarized view showing events per date.
  - **Red Highlighted Card** – Conflict exists.
  - **Green Highlighted Card** – No conflict.

### 3. Adding a Schedule (Detailed View Only)

1. Choose a manager from the filter dropdown.
2. Select a date from the dropdown calendar.
3. Add the **status**:
   - Operational (Ops)
   - Non-Operational (Non-Ops)
4. Add **location** (optional).
5. To add multiple schedules on the same date, repeat the process.
6. Save to create the schedule.

> **Tip:** All events under the contract will automatically be shown for the selected manager, so you have complete visibility of assignments and workload.

### 4. Editing or Deleting a Schedule

- Select the existing schedule in detailed view.
- Edit status, location, or delete the schedule entirely.
- Save changes to update.

### 5. Manager Allocation

- **Managers Tab** – Opens a modal to update hierarchy (Primary, Backup). You can also:
  - Set a new primary manager.
  - Delete managers.
- **Support Tab** – Add or delete support managers.
- **Shadowers Tab** – Add or delete shadowers.

### 6. Resolving Conflicts (Detailed View Only)

1. Conflicted schedules are shown in **red** in detailed view.
2. Click **Resolve Conflict** to see the event causing the conflict.
3. Select a **new primary manager**; the conflicted primary manager automatically becomes secondary.
4. Save changes to finalize resolution.

### 7. Health Warning

- If adding or updating a schedule results in **5 or more consecutive working days** for a manager, a notification will appear:  
  “Adding this event would create number of days greater than 5 consecutive working days.”
- Helps prevent manager burnout and ensures workload compliance.
