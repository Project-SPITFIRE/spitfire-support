The **Schedules** feature is the central hub for managing and viewing work schedules. It allows operations support to add, update, or delete schedules while providing powerful filtering, search, and multiple viewing modes for precise schedule management. A single user can also have **multiple schedules assigned in a single day** to reflect varied tasks or shifts.

## Key Features of Schedules

  • Create new schedules for yourself, team members, or all users.  
  • Assign operational details, activities, and multiple shifts per day.  
  • **Note**: Adding schedules is only available in **Calendar View**.

- **Update Schedule**  
  • Edit existing schedules to resolve conflicts or make changes.

- **Delete Schedule**  
  • Remove schedules no longer valid or needed.

- **Multiple Schedules per Day**  
  • A single user can have multiple schedules (e.g., split shifts or different task types) in the same calendar day.

  • **Restrictions**:  
   – Multi-select cannot be used on the **current date**.  
   – You cannot add schedules on **previous dates**.

## Quick Tips

- **Schedules can only be added in Calendar View** — Table View is for reviewing and editing only.
- Use **multiple schedules per day** to represent split shifts or complex task structures.
- Use **Calendar View** for quick navigation, and **Table View** when reviewing multiple entries per day.
- Remember: **multi-select works only on future dates** — current and past dates are restricted.
- Always check **role + team filters** to ensure proper workload distribution.
- Use **search by name** for fast access when handling large team or org-wide schedules.
