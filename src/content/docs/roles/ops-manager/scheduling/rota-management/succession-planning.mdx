## Coverage Scenarios

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Primary Manager Unavailable">
    <p>
      Check succession plan for 2nd Manager → Contact immediately → Brief on current status → Provide access/resources → Update stakeholders
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Multiple Managers Unavailable">
    <p>
      Move to 3rd Manager → If none exists, identify alternative → Consider temporary promotion → Escalate if needed
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="New Contract Coverage">
    <p>
      Create succession plan immediately → Assign experienced 1st Manager → Designate backup (2nd Manager) → Plan additional backups
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Developing Junior Managers">
    <p>
      Start as 5th/6th Manager → Provide training/shadowing → Gradually promote through levels → Increase responsibility under supervision
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Complete Coverage Strategy">
    <p>
      Every contract needs 1st and 2nd Manager minimum → Critical contracts need 3rd Manager → High-value contracts should have full coverage → Review quarterly
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Skills-Based Assignments">
    <p>
      Match backups to contract requirements → Ensure necessary training → Consider experience levels → Provide development opportunities
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Regular Testing">
    <p>
      Have backups lead events periodically → Update when team changes → Review effectiveness after coverage → Adjust based on performance
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Health Monitoring

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Red Flags">
    <p>
      <Badge text="Risk" variant="danger" /> Contracts with only 1st Manager → Gaps in succession chain → Same person backing too many contracts → Untrained backups
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Health Indicators">
    <p>
      <Badge text="Healthy" variant="success" /> All contracts have 2+ levels → Backups trained and ready → Regular rotation testing → Prompt updates with team changes
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

:::note[Minimum Coverage]
Every contract should have at least a 1st Manager (primary) and 2nd Manager (first backup). Incomplete succession plans create operational risk.
