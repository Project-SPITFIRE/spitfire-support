## Best Practices

  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Backup Coverage Planning">
    <p>
      Always assign 2nd Manager for critical events → Use 3rd-6th for high-priority operations → Ensure backups have necessary training → Update with team changes
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Effective Planning">
    <p>
      Map events 2-4 weeks ahead → Check succession planning for backup coverage → Review weekly for conflicts → Communicate assignments promptly
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Common Scenarios
