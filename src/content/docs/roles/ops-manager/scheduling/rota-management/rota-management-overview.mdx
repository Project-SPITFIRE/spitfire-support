    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Operational Elements">
    <p>
      <strong>Contracts</strong>: Agreements defining event allocations<br/>
      <strong>Events</strong>: Specific activities requiring manager coverage<br/>

    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Common Workflows

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Planning Monthly Schedules">
    <p>
      Select month/year in Events Mapping → Review manager availability → Map events to managers → Check succession backup coverage → Finalize schedules
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Managing Contract Allocations">
    <p>
      Go to Contract Allocation → Review contracts and event counts → Edit allocations as needed → Monitor operational days usage → Create new contracts
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Ensuring Operational Continuity">
    <p>
      Access Succession Planning → Review contracts without backup coverage → Assign backup managers → Document succession plans → Update with team changes
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Planning & Balance">
    <p>
      Plan 2-4 weeks ahead → Distribute events fairly → Maintain backup coverage → Review weekly for conflicts → Coordinate with managers
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Coverage Standards">
    <p>
      Every contract needs primary + backup → Critical contracts need 3+ levels → Regular succession plan testing → Clear communication of assignments
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

:::note[Integration]
All rota management features work together - events mapped here appear in schedules, contracts need succession planning, and managers require availability coordination.
