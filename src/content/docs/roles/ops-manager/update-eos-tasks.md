# Update Assigned EOS Subtask

You can update the status and details of EOS subtasks assigned to you within larger EOS tasks.

## Accessing your subtasks

1. Navigate to **Management** → **EOS Actions**
2. Find the task containing your subtask
3. Click on the task to open **Task Details**
4. Locate the **Subtasks** section

## Task details overview

When you open a task, you'll see:

**Task Information panel**:
- Due Date for the overall task
- Last Updated timestamp
- Assigned To (main task owner)

**Progress Overview panel**:
- Visual progress indicator
- "Subtasks Completed" count (e.g., "∞" when infinite/ongoing)
- Percentage completed

**Main sections**:
- Description
- Subtasks (where you make updates)
- Activity log
- Notes

## Understanding the subtasks section

The Subtasks section displays a table with columns:
- **Subtask Name**: Description of the work item
- **Priority**: Importance level
- **Assigned To**: Person responsible
- **Status**: Current state of the subtask

You can add new subtasks using the **+ Add Subtask** button (if you have permission).

## How to update a subtask

1. In the Task Details dialog, scroll to **Subtasks** section
2. Find your assigned subtask in the table
3. Click on the subtask row or edit icon
4. Update the available fields:
   - **Status**: Change between Not Started, In Progress, Completed
   - **Progress notes**: Add updates about your work
   - **Completion details**: Document what was accomplished

## Subtask status options

**Not Started**:
- You haven't begun work on this subtask
- Use this when first assigned
- Change once you start working

**In Progress**:
- You're actively working on the subtask
- Work has begun but isn't complete
- Most common status during execution

**Completed**:
- Subtask is fully finished
- All requirements have been met
- Ready for review or sign-off

## Adding activity updates

In the **Activity** section:
- System automatically logs status changes
- You can see when you or others made updates
- Provides audit trail of progress
- Shows timestamps for all changes

## Adding notes to the task

Use the **Notes** section to:
1. Click in the "Add a note..." field
2. Type your update, question, or comment
3. Click **Add Note** button
4. Notes appear for all task stakeholders to see

**What to include in notes**:
- Progress updates on your subtask
- Challenges or blockers encountered
- Questions for Ops Support or other team members
- Coordination needs with other assignees
- Completion confirmations

## Best practices for subtask updates

**Update regularly**: At least weekly, or when significant progress occurs
**Be specific**: Provide concrete details about what was accomplished
**Flag blockers immediately**: Don't wait to report obstacles
**Include relevant details**: Help others understand your progress
**Communicate changes**: Use notes to keep stakeholders informed

## Example update scenarios

**Starting work**:
- Change status from "Not Started" to "In Progress"
- Add note: "Beginning work on this subtask, reviewing requirements"

**Progress update**:
- Keep status as "In Progress"
- Add note: "Completed first phase, moving to second phase next"

**Encountering blocker**:
- Status remains "In Progress"
- Add note: "Blocked on X, need input from Y team before proceeding"

**Completing work**:
- Change status to "Completed"
- Add note: "Finished all requirements, deliverables ready for review"

## Coordination with other subtasks

Some tasks have multiple subtasks:
- Check if your work depends on others completing theirs
- Review other subtasks to understand full scope
- Coordinate with other assigned team members
- Note dependencies in your updates

## Priority awareness

Subtasks may have different priorities within the same task:
- Focus on higher priority subtasks first
- Balance multiple subtasks based on priority and deadline
- Escalate if high-priority items are blocked
- Communicate timeline concerns early

## What you can see vs. what you can edit

**You can view**:
- All subtasks within tasks assigned to you
- Progress of other team members
- Overall task status and description
- Activity history and notes from others

**You can edit**:
- Your own assigned subtasks' status
- Notes and comments on the task
- Progress updates for your work

:::note[Subtask permissions]
You can only update the status of subtasks specifically assigned to you. If you need to modify other subtasks or the main task details, contact the task owner or Ops Support team.

## Managing your subtask workload

**Review regularly**: Check EOS Actions dashboard weekly
**Plan time**: Allocate time based on subtask complexity and deadline
**Communicate capacity**: Let Ops Support know if workload is unmanageable
**Request help**: Ask for assistance if subtasks are blocked or too complex
**Report completion**: Update status promptly when finished

## Using the progress overview

The Progress Overview shows:
- Overall task completion percentage
- Number of subtasks completed vs. total
- Visual indicator of progress

This helps you understand:
- How your subtask fits into the bigger picture
- Overall task timeline and urgency
- Whether the task is on track

## Troubleshooting

**Can't update a subtask**:
- Verify the subtask is assigned to you
- Check if task has been closed or archived
- Contact Ops Support if you should have access

**Don't understand requirements**:
- Review the task Description section
- Check notes for clarifications
- Add a note asking for clarification
- Contact the task creator or Ops Support

**Multiple conflicting subtasks**:
- Note the conflict in the task notes
- Contact Ops Support to prioritize
- Document which subtask you're focusing on
- Request timeline adjustment if needed

## After completing your subtask

1. Update status to "Completed"
2. Add final note documenting what was accomplished
3. Attach any deliverables if applicable
4. Notify stakeholders if required
5. Check if any follow-up tasks are needed
6. Task owner or Ops Support will review and close if all subtasks complete
