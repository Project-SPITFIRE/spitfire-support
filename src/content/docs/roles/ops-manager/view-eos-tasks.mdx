## Weekly planning approach

1. **Start of week**: Review all current week tasks
2. **Check priorities**: Identify ðŸ”´ high-priority items
3. **Review subtasks**: Understand required work
4. **Coordinate**: Connect with team on shared tasks
5. **Update progress**: Keep subtask status current

You'll only see EOS tasks where you're assigned as owner, responsible for subtasks, or listed as a stakeholder.
