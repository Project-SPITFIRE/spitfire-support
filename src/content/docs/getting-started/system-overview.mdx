- **Management roles** focus on team oversight, planning, and approval workflows
- **Operational roles** concentrate on task execution and individual schedule management

### Data integration

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="CIPHR Integration">
    <p>
      <strong>Purpose</strong>: Synchronize schedule and payroll data<br/>
      <strong>Function</strong>: Automatic data exchange for approved schedules<br/>
      <strong>Monitoring</strong>: Status tracking for successful synchronization
    </p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Real-time Updates">
    <p>
      <strong>Notifications</strong>: Instant updates when assignments or statuses change<br/>
      <strong>Collaboration</strong>: Multiple users can work on related items simultaneously<br/>
